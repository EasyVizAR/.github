EasyVizAR provides a comprehensive solution for visual collaboration between
emergency responder team members through augmented reality (AR) equipment. Our
solution demonstrates the capabilities of AR to enhance situational awareness
and collaboration among team members in indoor scenarios. Some of the
demonstrated capabilities include easy access to maps with synchronized
landmark points, visual navigation cues to a target point, and a command
dashboard providing a top-down view of the situation.  EasyVizAR incorporates a
modular edge computing system that augments the capabilities of AR devices and
ensures secure and responsive exchange of critical data among team members of
different roles.
